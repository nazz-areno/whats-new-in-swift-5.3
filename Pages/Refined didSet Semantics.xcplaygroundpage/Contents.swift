/* Refined didSet Semantics */
//SE-0268 adjusts the way the didSet property observers work so that they are more efficient. This doesn’t require a code change unless you were somehow relying on the previous buggy behavior; you’ll just get a small performance improvement for free.

//Internally, this change makes Swift not retrieve the previous value when setting a new value in any instance where you weren’t using the old value, and if you don’t reference oldValue and don’t have a willSet Swift will change your data in-place.

//If you do happen to be relying on the old behavior, you can work around it simply by referencing oldValue to trigger your custom getter, like this:

didSet {
    _ = oldValue
}
