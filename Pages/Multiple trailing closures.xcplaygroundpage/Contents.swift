/* Multiple trailing closures */

//SE-0279 introduced multiple trailing closures, making for a simpler way to call a function with several closures.

//This will be particularly welcome in SwiftUI, where code like this:

struct OldContentView: View {
    @State private var showOptions = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.showOptions.toggle()
        }) {
            Image(systemName: "gear")
        }
    }
}
//Can now be written as this:

struct NewContentView: View {
    @State private var showOptions = false

    var body: some View {
        Button {
            self.showOptions.toggle()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "gear")
        }
    }
}
//Technically there is no reason why label: needs to be on the same line as the preceding }, so you could even write this if you wanted:

struct BadContentView: View {
    @State private var showOptions = false

    var body: some View {
        Button {
            self.showOptions.toggle()
        }

        label: {
            Image(systemName: "gear")
        }
    }
}
//However, I would caution against that for readability â€“ a floating piece of code like that is never pleasant, and in Swift it looks like a labeled block rather than a second parameter to the Button initializer.

//Note: There was quite a lot of heated discussion about multiple trailing closures on the Swift forums, and I would like to use this opportunity to remind folks to be civil when taking part in our community. Notable syntax changes like this one are always strange at first, but please give it time and see how you get on in practice.
