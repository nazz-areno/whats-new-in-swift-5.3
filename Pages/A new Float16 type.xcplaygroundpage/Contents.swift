/* A new Float16 type */
//SE-0277 introduced a new half-precision floating point type called Float16, which is commonly used in graphics programming and machine learning.

//This new floating-point type fits in alongside Swiftâ€™s other similar types:

let first: Float16 = 5
let second: Float32 = 11
let third: Float64 = 7
let fourth: Float80 = 13
